    content: "Mayank is a highly motivated and capable student who I expect to achieve great things in academia and beyond. I have been mentoring and supervising him in undergraduate research programs at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign since the 2022 Spring term. In this time Mayank has studied mathematical and information-theoretic aspects of quantum information theory, and solved research-level problems together with undergraduate researchers under my supervision. In the current academic year 2023-24 Mayank is writing a senior thesis with me. It has been, and continues to be, a pleasure supervising him and engaging with him in discussions."
